He was doing poorly academically; he didn't even know how to follow the instructions on the tests, let alone do well in them.  Socially he was immature, often embarrassing those closest to him.

So we worked on our attitudes and behavior toward him and we tried to work on his.  We attempted to psyche him up using positive mental attitude techniques.  \"Come on, son! You can do it! We know you can.  Put your hands a little higher on the bat and keep your eye on the ball.  Don't swing till it gets close to you.\" And if he did a little better, we would go to great lengths to reinforce him.  \"That's good, son, keep it up.\"___\n",

      "______\n",
      "___In stark contrast, almost all the literature in the first 150 years or so focused on what could be called the character ethic as the foundation of success -- things like integrity, humility, fidelity, temperance, courage, justice, patience, industry, simplicity, modesty, and the Golden Rule.  Benjamin Franklin's autobiography is representative of that literature.  It is, basically, the story of one man's effort to integrate certain principles and habits deep within his nature.___\n",

      "______\n",
      "___But shortly after World War I the basic view of success shifted from the character ethic to what we might call the personality ethic.  Success became more a function of personality, of public image, of attitudes and behaviors, skills and techniques, that lubricate the processes of human interaction.  This personality ethic essentially took two paths: one was human and public relations techniques, and the other was positive mental attitude (PMA).  Some of this philosophy was expressed in inspiring and sometimes valid maxims such as \"Your attitude determines your altitude,\" \"Smiling wins more friends than frowning,\" and \"Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe it can achieve.___\n",
      "______\n",

      "______\n",
      "___Some of this literature acknowledged character as an ingredient of success, but tended to compartmentalize it rather than recognize it as foundational and catalytic.

      "___This personality ethic, I began to realize, was the subconscious source of the solutions Sandra and I were attempting to use with our son.  As I thought more deeply about the difference between the personality and character ethics, I realized that Sandra and I had been getting social mileage out of our children's good behavior, and, in our eyes, this son simply didn't measure up.  Our image of ourselves, and our role as good, caring parents was even deeper than our image of our son and perhaps influenced it.  There was a lot more wrapped up in the way we were seeing and handling the problem than our concern for our son's welfare.___\n",
      "______\n",
      "___As Sandra and I talked, we became painfully aware of the powerful influence of our character and motives and of our perception of him.  We knew that social comparison motives were out of harmony with our deeper values and could lead to conditional love and eventually to our son's lessened sense of self-worth.  So we determined to focus our efforts on us -- not on our techniques, but on our deepest motives and our perception of him.  Instead of trying to change him, we tried to stand apart -- to separate us from him -- and to sense his identity, individuality, separateness, and worth.___\n",
      "______\n",
      "___Through deep thought and the exercise of faith and prayer, we began to see our son in terms of his own uniqueness.  We saw within him layers and layers of potential that would be realized at his own pace and speed.  We decided to relax and get out of his way and let his own personality emerge.  We saw our natural role as being to affirm, enjoy, and value him.  We also conscientiously worked on our motives and cultivated internal sources of security so that our own feelings of worth were not dependent on our children's \"acceptable\" behavior.___\n",

My duplicity will breed distrust, and everything I do -- even using so-called good human relations techniques -- will be perceived as manipulative.

I've learned that once children gain a sense of real possession, they share very naturally, freely, and spontaneously.___\n",

When relationships are strained and the air charged with emotion, an attempt to teach is often perceived as a form of judgment and rejection.

It may have been that the emotional maturity to do that was beyond my level of patience and internal control at the time.___\n",

Many people who give mechanically or refuse to give and share in their marriages and families may never have experienced what it means to possess themselves, their own sense of identity and self-worth.

The mower worked well for two seasons, but then it began to break down.  When I tried to revive it with service and sharpening, I discovered the engine had lost over half its original power capacity.  It was essentially worthless.___\n",

      "______\n",
      "___In our quest for short-term returns, or results, we often ruin a prized physical asset -- a car, a computer, a washer or dryer, even our body or our environment.  Keeping P and PC in balance makes a tremendous difference in the effective use of physical assets.___\n",
      "______\n",
      "___It also powerfully impacts the effective use of financial assets.  How often do people confuse principal with interest? Have you ever invaded principal to increase your standard of living, to get more golden eggs? The decreasing principal has decreasing power to produce interest or income.  And the dwindling capital becomes smaller and smaller until it no longer supplies even our basic needs.___\n",
      "______\n",
      "___Our most important financial asset is our own capacity to earn.  If we don't continually invest in improving our own PC, we severely limit our options.  We're locked into our present situation, running scared of our corporation or our boss's opinion of us, economically dependent and defensive.___\n",

      "______\n",
      "___In the human area, the P/PC Balance is equally fundamental, but even more important, because people control physical and financial assets.___\n",
      "______\n",
      "___When two people in a marriage are more concerned about getting the golden eggs, the benefits, than they are in preserving the relationship that makes them possible, they often become insensitive and inconsiderate, neglecting the little kindnesses and courtesies so important to a deep relationship.  They begin to use control levers to manipulate each other, to focus on their own needs, to justify their own position and look for evidence to show the wrongness of the other person.  The love, the richness, the softness, and spontaneity begin to deteriorate.  The goose gets sicker day by day.___\n",
      "______\n",
      "___And what about a parent's relationship with a child? When children are little, they are very dependent, very vulnerable.  It becomes so easy to neglect the PC work -- the training, the communicating, the relating, the listening.  It's easy to take advantage, to manipulate, to get what you want the way you want it -- right now! You're bigger, you're smarter, and you're right! So why not just tell them what to do? If necessary, yell at them, intimidate them, insist on your way.___\n",

You will come to know yourself in a deeper, more meaningful way -- your nature, your deepest values and your unique contribution capacity.  As you live your values, your sense of identity, integrity, control, and inner-directedness will infuse you with both exhilaration and peace.  You will define yourself from within, rather than by people's opinions or by comparisons to others.  \"Wrong\" and \"right\" will have little to do with being found out.___\n",

      "___Ironically, you'll find that as you care less about what others think of you; you will care more about what others think of themselves and their worlds, including their relationship with you.  You'll no longer build your emotional life on other people's weaknesses.  In addition, you'll find it easier and more desirable to change because there is something -- some core deep within -- that is essentially changeless.___\n",

The limits and parameters of your life are set, and, basically, you can't do much about it.___\n",

      "______\n",
      "___His parents, his brother, and his wife died in the camps or were sent to the gas ovens.  Except for his sister, his entire family perished.  Frankl himself suffered torture and innumerable indignities, never knowing from one moment to the next if his path would lead to the ovens or if he would be among the \"saved\" who would remove the bodies or shovel out the ashes of those so fated.___\n",
      "______\n",
      "___One day, naked and alone in a small room, he began to become aware of what he later called \"the last of the human freedoms\" -- the freedom his Nazi captors could not take away.  They could control his entire environment, they could do what they wanted to his body, but Viktor Frankl himself was a self-aware being who could look as an observer at his very involvement.  His basic identity was intact.___\n",
      "______\n",
      "___He could decide within himself how all of this was going to affect him.  Between what happened to him, or the stimulus, and his response to it, was his freedom or power to choose that response.___\n",

      "______\n",
      "___Through a series of such disciplines -- mental, emotional, and moral, principally using memory and imagination -- he exercised his small, embryonic freedom until it grew larger and larger, until he had more freedom than his Nazi captors.  They had more liberty, more options to choose from in their environment; but he had more freedom, more internal power to exercise his options.  He became an inspiration to those around him, even to some of the guards.  He helped others find meaning in their suffering and dignity in their prison existence.___\n",
      "______\n",
      "___In the midst of the most degrading circumstances imaginable, Frankl used the human endowment of self-awareness to discover a fundamental principle about the nature of man: Between stimulus and response, man has the freedom to choose.___\n",
      "______\n",
      "___Within the freedom to choose are those endowments that make us uniquely human.  In addition to self-awareness, we have imagination -- the ability to create in our minds beyond our present reality.___\n",
      "______\n",
      "___We have conscience -- a deep inner awareness of right and wrong, of the principles that govern our behavior, and a sense of the degree to which our thoughts and actions are in harmony with them.  And we have independent will -- the ability to act based on our self-awareness, free of all other influences.___\n",
      "______\n",
      "___Even the most intelligent animals have none of these endowments.  To use a computer metaphor, they are programmed by instinct and/or training.  They can be trained to be responsible, but they can't take responsibility for that training; in other words, they can't direct it.  They can't change the programming.  They're not even aware of it.___\n",
      "______\n",
      "___But because of our unique human endowments, we can write new programs for ourselves totally apart from our instincts and training.  This is why an animal's capacity is relatively limited and man's is unlimited.  But if we live like animals, out of our own instincts and conditioning and conditions, out of our collective memory, we too will be limited.___\n",
      "______\n",
      "___The deterministic paradigm comes primarily from the study of animals -- rats, monkeys, pigeons, dogs -- and neurotic and psychotic people.  While this may meet certain criteria of some researchers because it seems measurable and predictable, the history of mankind and our own self-awareness tell us that this map doesn't describe the territory at all!___\n",
      "______\n",
      "___Our unique human endowments lift us above the animal world.  The extent to which we exercise and develop these endowments empowers us to fulfill our uniquely human potential.  Between stimulus and response is our greatest power -- the freedom to choose.___\n",

      "___\"Proactivity\" Defined___\n",
      "______\n",
      "___In discovering the basic principle of the nature of man, Frankl described an accurate self-map from which he began to develop the first and most basic habit of a highly effective person in any environment, the habit of Proactivity.___\n",
      "______\n",
      "___While the word proactivity is now fairly common in management literature, it is a word you won't find in most dictionaries.  It means more than merely taking initiative.  It means that as human beings, we are responsible for our own lives.  Our behavior is a function of our decisions, not our conditions.___\n",

They do not blame circumstances, conditions, or conditioning for their behavior.  Their behavior is a product of their own conscious choice, based on values, rather than a product of their conditions, based on feeling.___\n",
      "______\n",
      "___Because we are, by nature, proactive, if our lives are a function of conditioning and conditions, it is because we have, by conscious decision or by default, chosen to empower those things to control us.___\n",

      "___In making such a choice, we become reactive.  Reactive people are often affected by their physical environment.  If the weather is good, they feel good.  If it isn't, it affects their attitude and their performance.  Proactive people can carry their own weather with them.  Whether it rains or shines makes no difference to them.  They are value driven; and if their value is to produce good quality work, it isn't a function of whether the weather is conducive to it or not.___\n",
      "______\n",
      "___Reactive people are also affected by their social environment, by the \"social weather.\" When people treat them well, they feel well; when people don't, they become defensive or protective.  Reactive people build their emotional lives around the behavior of others, empowering the weaknesses of other people to control them.___\n",
      "______\n",
      "___The ability to subordinate an impulse to a value is the essence of the proactive person.  Reactive people are driven by feelings, by circumstances, by conditions, by their environment.  Proactive people are driven by values -- carefully thought about, selected and internalized values.___\n",

      "______\n",
      "___When we are dependent on the person with whom we are in conflict, both need and conflict are compounded.  Love-hate overreactions, fight-or-flight tendencies, withdrawal, aggressiveness, bitterness, resentment, and cold competition are some of the usual results.  When these occur, we tend to fall even further back on background tendencies and habits in an effort to justify and defend our own behavior and we attack our spouse's.___\n",

They become upset, guided by the emotions of the moment, spontaneously reacting to the immediate concern rather than the long-term growth and development of the child.

      "______\n",
      "___Money Centeredness.  Another logical and extremely common center to people's lives is making money.  Economic security is basic to one's opportunity to do much in any other dimension.

      "___Possession Centeredness.  A driving force of many people is possessions -- not only tangible, material possessions such as fashionable clothes, homes, cars, boats, and jewelry, but also the intangible possessions of fame, glory, or social prominence.

If I'm in the presence of someone of greater net worth or fame or status, I feel inferior.  If I'm in the presence of someone of lesser net worth or fame or status, I feel superior.  My sense of self-worth constantly fluctuates.  I don't have any sense of constancy or anchorage or persistent selfhood.  I am constantly trying to protect and insure my assets, properties, securities, position, or reputation.

In fact, the ability to manage well determines the quality and even the existence of the second creation.  Management is the breaking down, the analysis, the sequencing, the specific application, the time-bound left-brain aspect of effective self-government.

As a longtime student of this fascinating field, I am personally persuaded that the essence of the best thinking in the area of time management can be captured in a single phrase: Organize and execute around priorities.  That phrase represents the evolution of three generations of time-management theory, and how to best do it is the focus of a wide variety of approaches and materials.___\n",

Sunday (or some other day of the week that is special to you, your faith, or your circumstances) is often the ideal time to plan your more personally uplifting activities, including weekly organizing.

      "___The principle of win-win is fundamental to success in all our interactions, and  it embraces five interdependent dimensions of life.  It begins with character and moves toward relationships, out of which flow agreements.  It is nurtured in an environment where structure and systems are based on win-win.  And it involves process; we cannot achieve win-win ends with win-lose or lose-win means.___\n",

      "______\n",
      "___INTEGRITY.  We've already defined integrity as the value we place on ourselves.  Habits 1, 2, and 3 help us develop and maintain integrity.  As we clearly identify our values and proactively organize and execute around those values on a daily basis, we develop self-awareness and independent will by making and keeping meaningful promises and commitments.___\n",
      "______\n",
      "___There's no way to go for a win in our own lives if we don't even know, in a deep sense, what constitutes a win -- what is, in fact, harmonious with our innermost values.  And if we can't make and keep commitments to ourselves as well as to others, our commitments become meaningless.  We know it; others know it.  They sense duplicity and become guarded.  There's no foundation of trust and win-win becomes an ineffective superficial technique.  Integrity is the cornerstone in the foundation.___\n",
      "______\n",
      "___MATURITY.  Maturity is the balance between courage and consideration.  If a person can express his feelings and convictions with courage balanced with consideration for the feelings and convictions of another person, he is mature, particularly if the issue is very important to both parties.___\n",
      "______\n",
      "___If you examine many of the psychological tests used for hiring, promoting, and training purposes, you will find that they are designed to evaluate this kind of maturity.  Whether it's called the ego strength/empathy balance, the self confidence/respect for others balance, the concern for people/concern for tasks balance, \"I'm okay, you're okay\" in transactional analysis language, or 9.1, 1.9, 5.5, 9.9, in management grid language -- the quality sought for is the balance of what I call courage and consideration.___\n",
      "______\n",
      "___Respect for this quality is deeply ingrained in the theory of human interaction, management, and leadership.  It is a deep embodiment of the P/PC Balance.  While courage may focus on getting the golden egg, consideration deals with the long-term welfare of the other stakeholders.  The basic task of leadership is to increase the standard of living and the quality of life for all stakeholders.___\n",

It opens possibilities, options, alternatives, and creativity.___\n",

I think it was largely because the people were relatively mature.  They were in the final semester of their senior year, and I think they wanted more than just another good classroom experience.  They were hungry for something new and exciting, something that they could create that was truly meaningful.  It was \"an idea whose time had come\" for them. In addition, the chemistry was right.

There was usually an early moment that required considerable courage, perhaps in becoming extremely authentic, in confronting some inside truth about the individual or the organization or the family which really needed to be said, but took a combination of considerable courage and genuine love to say it.  Then others became more authentic, open, and honest, and the synergistic communication process began.

George Sheehan, the running guru, describes four roles: being a good animal (physical), a good craftsman (mental), a good friend (social), and a saint (spiritual).  Sound motivation and organization theory embrace these four dimensions or motivations -- the economic (physical); how people are treated (social); how people are developed and used (mental); and the service, the job, the contribution the organization gives (spiritual).___\n",

Quadrant I, because of its urgency, acts on us; it presses upon us constantly.  Personal PC must be pressed upon until it becomes second nature, until it becomes a kind of healthy addiction.

You might also spend an hour or two in the morning preparing for that presentation, even if you are only allowed a few minutes to stimulate everyone's interest in hearing a more extended preparation at the next board meeting.  This presentation would focus on the importance of always having a clearly specified purpose for each meeting and a well-thought-out agenda to which each person at the meeting has had the opportunity to contribute.

A possible Quadrant II approach to item number four would be to think through the entire relationship and performance agreement with that sales manager to see if the Quadrant II approach is being used.
